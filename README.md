## 🧠 WalkNav: YOLOv8-Based Assistive Navigation for the Visually Impaired

> **Empowering independent mobility using real-time path detection and audio guidance.**

---

### 📌 Project Overview

**WalkNav** is a computer vision-based assistive navigation system designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate outdoor environments. It uses a **YOLOv8 segmentation model** to detect walkable paths in real-time and provides **audio feedback** to guide users safely and effectively.

---

### 🛠️ Features

* ✅ Real-time walkable path detection using YOLOv8
* 🎯 Accurate segmentation trained on a custom-labeled dataset
* 🎙️ Audio feedback (e.g., “Turn Left”, “Move Forward”)
* 📷 Live camera input processing
* 🧩 Modular design for future upgrades like GPS navigation

### 🚀 How It Works

1. **Custom dataset** of 2,800+ annotated outdoor images
2. Images annotated using polygons to define footpaths (stored as JSON)
3. Converted to YOLOv8 segmentation format
4. Model trained using Ultralytics' YOLOv8 on CPU/GPU
5. Inference script uses webcam + TTS to give spoken directions

### 🧪 Model Performance

| Metric            | Score     |
| ----------------- | --------- |
| mAP\@0.5 (Mask)   | 0.94      |
| mAP\@0.5:0.95     | 0.79      |
| Precision (Mask)  | 0.94      |
| Recall (Mask)     | 0.87      |
| FPS (Live Camera) | 15–20 FPS |

### 🗣️ Audio Feedback

Real-time voice instructions:

* “Move Forward”
* “Turn Left”
* “Obstacle Ahead”

Powered by Python's `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech.
